Program generation.
-------------------

Unlike C-style compilation, multi-stage operation is
required.

To compile, run avmc with one or more source files (*.avma); this will
  generate a single program segment (*.avmo).  All source files specified on
  the command line will be merged into a single segment, as if they were all
  in a single source file.

To link, run avmc with one or more program segments and hardware 
  definitions; this will generate a single machine (*.avmm)
