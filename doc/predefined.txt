## Registers 
##
## Some basic registers are predifined.  The '$' is convention only, and 
## doesn't contribute to processing or parsing.
##
$IP -- Instruction pointer.  Address of the currently-executing instruction
$LR -- Link register.  Contains the address after the location of the 
      most recent jump.
$DOR -- Default operand register.  During program parsing, this register is
       used for missing operands.  (Which operand?  That's mnemonic-specific).
$PID -- Process ID register. Contains the process ID of the running thread.
$ETR -- Exception Table register.  Pointer to exception table.
$R0-$R15 -- General purpose.

## Ports

## Some basic ports are predifined.  The '@' is convention only, and 
## doesn't contribute to processing or parsing.

@out -- stdout
@err -- stderr
