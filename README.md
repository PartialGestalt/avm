Facilitative Extensible Programming

Non-physical pseudo processor. Yes, those are all adjectives.


Why?

Well, partially because I need a way to handle register manipulation and 
message exchange in an extensible way for an embedded project.

Mostly, though -- just to see what kinds of complexity can arise from a
simple start.
